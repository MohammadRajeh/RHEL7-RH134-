Basic SELinux security concepts (Security Enhanced Linux):
- There are two types of security, DAC (discretionary access control) and MAC (mandatory access control)
- A primary goal of SELinux is to protect user data from system services that have been compromised.
- In SElinux, system is defined as subject (users,services) and object (files/folders, ports, socket)
- A context is a label on processes, files, and ports that determine access.
- A boolean is a switch that enables/disables a set of policy rules. 
- There is a policy rule that permits Apache (the web server process running as httpd_t) to access files and directories with a context normally found in /var/www/html and other web server directories (httpd_sys_content_t). 
- There is no allow rule in the policy for files normally found in /tmp and /var/tmp, so access is not permitted.

[root@master ~]# id -Z
[root@master ~]# ps auxZ                 [root@master ~]# ps aux -Z
[root@master ~]# ls -Z
[root@master ~]# netstat -Z

Ex:
system_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0
system_u      ... User type
object_r      ... Role type
admin_home_t  ... Type
s0            ... mls(multi level security), mcs(multi category security)
================================================================
SELinux modes:
Enforcing mode: SELinux both logs and protects.
Permissive mode: used to trouble shoot issues. SELinux only logs.
Disabled mode: completely disables SELinux. 
- No reboot is required to go from enforcing to permissive or back again.
- A system reboot is required to disable SELinux entirely, or to get from disabled mode to enforcing or permissive mode.

[root@master ~]# getenforce 
[root@master ~]# sestatus
[root@master ~]# setenforce 0                   (permissive mode)
[root@master ~]# setenforce 1                   (enforcing mode)
[root@master ~]# vim /etc/selinux/config        (RHEL7)
[root@master ~]# vim /etc/sysconfig/selinux     (older versions)
================================================================
Changing SELinux Contexts:
- The context of the parent directory is assigned to the newly created file.
[root@master ~]# yum -y install httpd
[root@master ~]# systemctl start httpd
[root@master ~]# systemctl enable httpd
[root@master ~]# setenforce 0
[root@master ~]# vim /var/www/html/file.txt

firefox>> http://127.0.0.1/file.txt

[root@master ~]# chcon -t test_t /var/www/html/file.txt 
[root@master ~]# setenforce 1               (file now will not be accessible)

[root@master ~]# restorecon -R /var/www/html/file.txt 

- File contexts will be changed back to their default context if the system's file systems are relabeled at boot time.
================================================================
Monitoring SELinux violations:
[root@master ~]# rpm -qa | grep setroubleshoot
[root@master ~]# tailf /var/log/messages 
[root@master ~]# tailf /var/log/audit/audit.log 
[root@master ~]# sealert
