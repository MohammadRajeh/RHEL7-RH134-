Linux Process scheduling and multitasking:
- The way Linux (and other operating system) can actually run more precesses is by employing a technique calles time-slicing 
-The part of the linux kernrl taht performs this switching is called the process scheduler.
- three are exactly different levels of niceness   aa  process  can have (-20  to 19).
- By default, processes will inherit their nice level from their parent, which is usually 0.
- Only root is allowed to set negative nice levels and lower the nice level on existing processes.
- Un privileged users are only allowed to set positive nice levels, and they are only allowed to raise the nice level on their existing process, but cannot lower them.

# gnome-system-monitor
===============================================================================
Managing Process Proiorities:
- Processes are scheduled according to proiority.
- negative values are allowed only to root.
- When a process is started, it will inherit the nice level from list parent.

# ps l     (to show nice values)
# ps axo user,pid,nice,command 
# ps axo user,pid,command,nice --sort=nice
# ps axo user,pid,command,nice --sort=user


- The nice command is used to start a process with a user defined priority.
# nioce vim text &         (Default is 10)
[1] 9182
# nice -n 15 vim text &
# ps axo user,pid,command,nice  | grep firefox
