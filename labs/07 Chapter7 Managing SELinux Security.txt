Basic SELinux Security Concepts (Security Enhanced Linus):

- There are two types of security, DAC (discretionary access control) and MAC (Mandetory access control)
- A primary goal of SELinux is to protect user data from system services that have been compromised.
- In SELinux, system is defined as subject (users,services) and object (files/folders,ports, sockets)
- A context is a label on processes, files, and ports that determine access.
- A Boolean is a switch that enables/disables as set of policy rules.
- There is a policy rule that permits Apache (the web server process running as httpd_t) to access files and directories with a context normally
    found in /var/www/html and other web server directories (httpd_sys_content_t).
- There is no allow rule in the policy for files normally found in /tmp and /var/tmp, so access is not permitted.

# id -z
# ps auxz
# ps aux -z
# ls -z

# netstat -z


Ex:
system_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0
system_u        ... User type
object_r        ... Role Type
admin_home_t    ... Type
s0              ... mls(multi level security), mcs(multi category security)

=============================================================================================
SELinux Modes:
Enforcing Mode: SELinux both logs and protects.
Permissive Mode: USed to trouble shoot issues. SELinux only logs.
Disabled Mode: Completely disables SELinux.
-No rebbot is required to go from enforcing to permissive on back again.
- A system reboot is required to disable SELinux entirely, or to get from disabled mode to enforcing or permissive mode.


# getenforce 
# sestatus
# setenforce 0                      (Permissive Mode)
# setenforce 1                      (enforcing mode)
# vim /etc/selinux/config           (RHEL7 or obove)
# vim /etc/sysconfig/selinux        (older versions)


===================================================================================================
Changing SELinux Context:
    - The context of the parent directory is assigned to the newly created file.
